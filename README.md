PayPal payments test

During this small project I did the following:
- Created testing accounts for buyer and merchant on PayPal
- Installed Django-PayPal module using command 'pip install django-paypal'
- Create a Product model for store products
- Migrate the Product model and added a superuser
- Through django admin page I added Products onto our store
- Created the product buttons using PayPalPaymentsForm
- Successfully returned data after a purchase or a cancellation
